The url need to enter the program is:
<url>trending.html

By default it shows all the news topics. 
We can change the render as proxy_format=rss or proxy_format=json
Eg: <url>trending.html?proxy_format=json
(By default,it takes proxy_format as rss)
We have trending.dtd which is validated in Oxygen.

We are attaching a screenshot of the HTML validated in the Hw4 file. 
 
the sample_test.xml checks if our trending.dtd validates. The sample text is from the textarea that the webpage output has. The query we used for this sample was "obama".

We have also attached a sample test query screenshot.
